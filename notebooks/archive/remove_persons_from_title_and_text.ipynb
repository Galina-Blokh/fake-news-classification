      "Two African - American women who went for what they hoped would be a fun night out at a karaoke bar in Fresno ended up in a scene from a 1980 s after school special about racism . The women had ordered some drinks already and were waiting to sing Waterfalls by TLC when the bartenders began treating them like they were the only two black people in a bar full of racists . As it turned out , they were the only two black women in a bar full of racists . According to the women , a bartender told them they couldn t sing karaoke unless they ordered drinks , which they had already done . Another rather large bartender got right in their faces and screamed buy drinks at them . Ultimately the women were asked to leave . The bar , which is described as a dive on Facebook , unfortunately bit off more than it could chew as the two women turned out to be lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union . and , the two women treated so horribly , wrote an article on the ACLU blog describing their experience : Let s recap . Four white employees at a bar in Fresno called the police to kick out two Black women ( who happen to be ACLU attorneys ) and who appeared to be the only Black people there . These kinds of signs have been illegal in California since the Unruh Civil Rights Act in 1959 and nationally since a 1964 U.S. Supreme Court ruling outlawed segregation . When the police arrived , several customers explained to the officers that the bar staff were enforcing the rule against us only . Some told the police that a one drink rule did not exist . Others even tried to buy us drinks . But the bartenders would n t let them . And still , the police forced us two Black women in the bar to leave . Police departments are supposed to enforce criminal laws and threats to public safety , not enforce personal biases . The bartender and police claimed to be exercising the business supposed right to refuse service . This sounds too much like when the country still had colored sections and racially segregated water fountains . But this happened in March 2016 . Oh those poor , dumb racists . By now they have to be aware that they messed with the wrong people . Ignorance is bliss until it turns into a giant bigoted snake and bites you in the ass . Featured image from Twitter\n",

      "The Texas Bar Association is stepping up to the plate to nail for violating legal ethics . After the Supreme Court ruled same - sex marriage legal across the nation last summer , some red states threw a collective hissy fit over the decision . In Alabama , state Supreme Court Chief Justice ordered county judges to disobey the highest court in the land . Texas Republicans also threw a temper tantrum , especially Attorney General , who told county clerks to defy the Supreme Court ruling as well . I will do everything I can from this office to be a public voice for those standing in defense of their rights , Paxton vowed a day after the ruling came down . But unlike Moore , could end up losing his status on the bar . Because he told clerks to violate the law as interpreted by the Supreme Court , the Texas Bar Association has launched an investigation against Paxton for ethics violations . The new investigation against Paxton comes on top of his indictment for committing securities fraud . If convicted , he faces up to 99 years in prison . Houston lawyer said that the Board of Disciplinary Appeals is looking into whether or not Paxton should be disbarred , which would prevent him from practicing law in the state , provided being thrown in prison doesn t do the trick first . Attorney General Paxton has a right to disagree with a ruling of the Supreme Court , Rodriguez told Reuters . Lawyers do that every single day . What makes a difference is that you can not encourage people to violate that ruling and that law . Of course , Paxton denies being an unethical slug . This complaint has always lacked merit , and we are confident the legal process for resolving these complaints will bear that out , a statement from his office said . As usual , it will take time for the investigation to run its course before a decision is made , but it s hard to believe a legitimate bar association would allow Paxton to continue being a lawyer since it is clear that he defied federal law and the order of the Supreme Court to let same - sex couples legally marry . If they do n t remove him from the bar , what does that say about the ethics of the Texas Bar Association itself ? Featured image from texasattorneygeneral.gov\n",

      "According to Republicans , it is imperative that we protect women and children by instituting measures that punish transgender women for having a penis . Some measures would literally place a bounty on transgender people , financially rewarding anyone who spots a penis in the women s restroom . Others would impose heavy fines on transgender people simply for going to the correct bathroom . These measures , which combat alleged threats which have absolutely no basis in reality , have been decried nationwide by thinking individuals who realize that Republicans the very people imposing these harsh and pathetic laws on the rest of us are a greater danger to women and children than transgender people could ever be . While Republicans crow about their attempts to save woman and childkind from the evil penises that may or may not be attached to women whose primary goal in a bathroom is to relieve themselves , they ignore certain inconvenient truths like that children face greater danger from straight men in the men s restroom . On April 22 , a traveler at a Seattle airport noticed something horrifying : a man was snapping pictures of his 8 - year - old son in the bathroom . According to charging papers , the little boy was using the bathroom when North Carolina resident ( yes , he s from the same state that recently shamed the nation by protecting children from transgender women with it s asinine bathroom bill ) stood in the neighboring stall and began taking photos over the stall wall . The boy s father spotted the man performing this disgusting act and rushed to stop him . Are you taking pictures of my son ? the man demanded angrily . denied it , but the father saw a photo of his son still on the pervert s cell phone screen . He grabbed Gitlin s phone and slammed the stall closed as others called for police assistance . Gitlin was arrested at the scene . Police confiscated his phone and other electronic devices with which Gitlin was traveling . He was jailed and charged with voyeurism , but was released Saturday on $ 100,000 bond . To date , there have been zero instances of transgender people being arrested for bathroom misconduct , but the same can not be said for Republican lawmakers . Unfortunately , transgender people don t write the laws . In November , be sure to head to the polls and vote BLUE so we can end this absurdity and begin focusing on real , important issues like undoing the damage Republicans are inflicting on our nation .

Keeler s relationship with married Minister of War , whom she met , aged 19 , while swimming naked at the grand Buckinghamshire estate of his colleague , shocked socially conservative Britain in the early 1960s . Front - page revelations that she was also having an affair with a Soviet naval attache , , titillated the public and shone a light on the social and sexual mores of Britain s secretive ruling establishment .

      "( Reuters ) - Six current and former Michigan and Flint officials were criminally charged on Wednesday for their roles in the city ’s water crisis that was linked to an outbreak of Legionnaires ’ disease that caused at least 12 deaths , the state ’s attorney general said . Five of the officials , including Michigan Health and Human Services Director , were charged with involuntary manslaughter stemming from their roles in handling the crisis , Michigan Attorney General said in a statement . Involuntary manslaughter is a felony that carries a sentence of up to 15 years in prison . Lyon , 49 , was also charged with one count of misconduct in office . The felony charge carries a sentence of up to five years in prison . Four current and former state and Flint officials were also charged with involuntary manslaughter . The four had all been previously charged with lesser crimes in connection with the water crisis . The state ’s chief medical executive , , was charged Wednesday with obstruction of justice and lying to police . Michigan Governor said in a statement that Lyon and Wells have his “ full faith and confidence ” and would remain on duty and help in Flint ’s recovery . An attorney for Lyon could not be reached for comment . It was not immediately known if Wells had an attorney . Schuette said his team had not spoken with Snyder as part of the investigation . “ We attempted to interview the governor . We were not successful , ” Schuette said . He declined to elaborate . Previously , Schuette , when asked if Snyder was a target in the investigation , said there were no targets but “ nobody is off the table . ” Some critics have called for high - ranking state officials , including Snyder , to be charged . Snyder previously said he believed he had not done anything criminally wrong . “ The governor is n’t going to speculate on where the investigation is or is not headed , but he continues to cooperate fully , ” Snyder ’s spokeswoman said . Snyder ’s attorney , , said in a statement that Snyder was made available to testify under oath this spring after being told a subpoena would be produced , but that never occurred . He added that Snyder previously testified under oath to Congress . Wednesday ’s charges stem from more than 80 cases of Legionnaires ’ disease , including the fatalities , that were believed to be linked to the water in Flint after the city switched its source to the Flint River from Lake Huron in April 2014 . Lyon was aware of the Legionnaires ’ outbreak in Genesee County at least one year before he informed the public , according to court documents . His deliberate failure to inform the public resulted in the death of Genesee Township resident , 85 , from Legionnaires ’ in December 2015 , the documents said . Wells lied to police about when she became aware of the outbreak , according to the documents . She also threatened a team of independent researchers who were studying the source of the disease , court documents said . “ It ’s good to see that state Attorney General Schuette and his team are taking this matter seriously , ” Flint Mayor said in a statement . “ We all are waiting to see what else the investigation uncovers . ” The crisis in Flint erupted in 2015 when tests found high amounts of lead in blood samples taken from children in the predominantly black city of about 100,000 . The more corrosive river water caused lead to leach from pipes and into the drinking water . Lead levels in Flint ’s drinking water have now fallen below levels considered dangerous by federal regulators , state officials said last January . Others charged with involuntary manslaughter on Wednesday included former state - appointed emergency manager , former Flint city employee , and former state Department of Environmental Quality officials and Shekter - .\n",

      "BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Germany s Social Democrat ( SPD ) Foreign Minister said on Thursday that his party would not be quick to agree to another grand coalition with Chancellor s conservatives , as party leaders met with the president in a bid to end political deadlock . Merkel is casting around for a coalition partner after her center - right bloc shed support to the far right in a Sept. 24 election . Her attempts to form a three - way tie - up with the pro-business Free Democrats ( FDP ) and the Greens failed . The SPD , which saw its participation in a Merkel - led coalition government from 2013 - 17 rewarded with its worst election result in German post -war history , had been strongly opposed to another grand coalition . But under pressure from Germany s President - Walter , SPD leader has signaled willingness to discuss a way out of the political impasse . SPD Foreign Minister told broadcaster ZDF no one should expect his party - still ruling with the conservatives in a caretaker government - to immediately agree to join another grand coalition now that talks to form a three - way Jamaica alliance have failed . We re now in a process orchestrated by the president , in which we first need to look at what the possibilities are but no one can expect it to go quickly , he said , adding that it was up to the conservatives to show what they wanted . The conservatives , Greens and FDP took months to get nothing off ground so I d ask people not to put pressure on us , Gabriel said , adding that the conservatives needed to make clear what they wanted . Senior conservative and chancellery chief told ZDF the conservatives and SPD had presided over four years of economic prosperity and the SPD needed to decide if it would give that up or reconsider its decision to go into opposition . We re making the case for that because we think one of our trademarks , alongside Made in Germany , is Stability Made in Germany , Altmaier said . He added that many people expected Germany to manage to form a government , adding : Everyone has to live up to that . Steinmeier , a former SPD lawmaker and foreign minister , hosted a meeting on Thursday that lasted just over two hours between Merkel , her Bavarian conservative ally and Schulz , as part of his efforts to facilitate the formation of a stable government . The parties are all due to hold high - level meetings on Friday to discuss how to proceed . Sources in the SPD said all options would be discussed - ranging from a re-run of the grand coalition with the conservatives to new elections . Merkel is set to hold a telephone conference with senior party members on Friday to discuss the meeting with Steinmeier but the conservatives do not expect the SPD to agree to official coalition talks until after its party congress next week . Almost two - thirds of Germans , surveyed between Nov.22 and Nov.27 , want the SPD to start talks with the conservatives on forming another coalition of the center - right and center - left , an Allensbach poll showed . The atmosphere has been soured by the decision of the conservative agriculture minister to back a European Union proposal to extend the use of a weedkiller for another five years - a measure opposed by the SPD . In reaction , SPD members have called for compensation and set various policy conditions . German Interior Minister de , a conservative , told reporters a stable government was urgently needed to move ahead on security priorities such as hiring more police . He told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper that the conservatives were trying to form a stable government with the SPD , if the SPD would agree . He added : Only if this attempt fails do we need to think about other steps - not now . FDP leader , who walked out of attempts to form the Jamaica alliance , told newspaper Rheinische Post a grand coalition would be more stable and more advantageous than a Jamaica tie - up . The business wing of Merkel s Christian Democrats called on Merkel to seriously consider a minority government , warning that another grand coalition would only be possible for the price of even more unaffordable promises in social policy .\n",
